/*
In this excercise you will combine two words together within a function. 

1) Declare two varaibles for 'word1' and 'word2'. Set the initial values of each to a random word. 

2) Create a function called 'wordCombine' with (word1, word2) as the parameters.

3) Add the words together in the function and return the added value.

4) Call the function in a console.log method that exists OUTSIDE of the function. This will print the return values of the function to the console.
